<div> In order to use the program, go to "Script.py " and at the end of the file, change the "path_Picture Folder" and "NewFolder".</div>

The program creates folders with the names of pictures in the New Folder path and then throws pictures into these folders. The program is written in classes, so there will be no problems modifying the code.
